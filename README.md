# tinykey

A project just for fun, to see if I can type on it.

## The rough idea

The layout:

```
↑ ◐ ● ◑ ↹ ⌫      ↩ ␣ ◐ ● ◑ ↓
```

Imagine mapping the home row `ASDFG` to three keys, using chords.
Let's say we only have the `SDF` keys, the mapping will be like this:

```
S = A
SD = S
D = D
DF = F
F = G
```

So, if you wanted to type `SAD` then you would press `SD` `S` `D`. The grouped keys becomes a chord for your ring and middle finger.
Now then, what if you wanted to type `FEAST`?

Notice that `↑` on the pinky? It shifts the home row up.
Before things get crazy, let's rename `SDF` to `◐●◑`.

Now, then `FEAST` becomes:

```
F  E  A S  T
●◑ ↑● ● ◐● ↑◑ 
```

The same applies for the `↓` on the right pinky. This shifts the home row down.

So what about the thumbs then?

The left thumb has two keys, a TAB `↹` and a BACKSPACE `⌫`. 
The right thumb has RETURN `↩` and SPACE `␣`.
However, when held they enter other layers.

In my (still only slideware) config, I've mapped the numbers to the top row on the SPACE layer.
So, for me to type out `1337` it would be:

```
1   3   3   7
↑◐␣ ↑●␣ ↑●␣ ↑␣●◑
```

I will post my complete keymap when it's ready.
